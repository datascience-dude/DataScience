We've collected our data. 
And we've noticed that you know what one of the biggest losses to our company 
is when companies go bankrupt and for our various investment strategies. 
So what we'd like to do is take a look at our historical data and see if 
there's any way that we can predict in the future that a company might go 
bankrupt, so that we can divest ourselves ahead of time.

Oh, and just to clarify, this dataset is collected over five years, but we don't care 
the exact year that a company will go bankrupt, just whether or not they will go bankrupt at all,
 based on the data. Thanks!
